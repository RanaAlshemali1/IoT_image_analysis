# IoT: Android App for Real-Time Stream Analysis using tensorflowlite
The aim is to allow machine learning results on resource poor devices like phones by leveraging the LAN WiFi bandwidth and latency to send and receive datato other devices for computation. The phone will just act as a sensor for input and receives the output, all the processing will be carried out on the compute machines in parallel. This will enable us to receive the result almost in real time and without much workload overhead. To reach an initial goal of implementation we will be developing our idea between only 2 android devices.
